## A local web server that a device could run to facilitate configuration

** UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

The purpose is to configure:

- A unique device identifier.
- A git repository containing the local application (i.e., node.js/npm package) 
- Base URL for the service (e.g., http://helloiot.cafjs.com ).
- Wireless configuration (SSID, WPA password...)

To bootstrap using just a wireless connection, the device becomes an access point when it cannot connect to a client network, or the wireless interface has not been properly configured.
